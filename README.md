# Poke-Shop

New version of an old project.

In this project you will see a project architected in MVP, with 4 layers per feature, View, Presenter, Model and Service.
I used Swift Package Manager, so you don't need to install nothing with commands, just download the ziped project and wait xcode do its job.

The app is a fake shop, in here you can purchase your pokemon, pokemons that are listed by rarity, after your purchase you will can see the history of that in profile. 

Thank you for taking a look and if you want to send any feedbacks be free :)
